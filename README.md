# Key-value zip (Kzip).

This library (although currently we are far from true library) presents you a key-value compression storage.

1) kzip.

`mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make`

Then write `./kzip --help` for help. And you can run tester that tests my library on any file.

Good luck!

Plans:

Try boost::dynamic_bitset instead of std::vector<char>;
Write simple tests inside the library;
Have some fun with perf record and perf report;
Documentation for usage;
